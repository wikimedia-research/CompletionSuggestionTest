## Introduction

The **completion suggester** is meant to replace prefix searching, with the aim of increasing recall. Completion suggester benefits include: less typos suggested (e.g. if the redirect is close to the canonical title we will display the canonical title), fuzzy searching, and ignoring stop words. The drawbacks of completion suggester are: precision is sometimes very bad because the scoring formula is not well designed for some kind of pages, fuzzy searching can display weird results, and page titles with punctuation or special characters only are not searchable.

## Methods

### Data

On every page load we do a 1 in 10,000 check, and if passed for that one page view then the user gets entered into the test as a control. If the check failed, we do another draw (1 in 9,999) for entering the user into the test as a test subject, with the completion suggester instead of prefix searching.

### Analysis

We performed the analysis using Bayesian methods for categorical data in the software R using packages and code by Albert (2014), Overstall and King (2014), and Agresti and Min (2005).

### German Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia

So far we have looked at the results pooled across the two populations of users. In this section, we look at the outcomes for German Wikipedia and English Wikipedia users separately.
