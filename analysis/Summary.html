<h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul id="summary">
    
  <li>Zero results rate in the searches using completion suggester goes down by 7.8%, with a 95% probability that the difference can be between 6.4% and 9.1%. They are also 1.1-1.2 times more likely to get nonzero results than the control group.</li>
  <li>Completion suggester was actually <strong>more effective</strong> when searching German Wikipedia:
    <ul>
      <li>Zero results rate goes down by 6.3%-11.8% in German Wikipedia searches using the completion suggester. The <em>odds</em> of getting nonzero results when using the suggester were 1.5-2.2 times those of controls.</li>
      <li>While in English Wikipedia, the zero results rate goes down by 5.8%-9% when using the completion suggester. The <em>odds</em> were 1.5-1.8 times the odds of controls, which is still good, but not as good as German Wikipedia searches.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Further research is needed to assess the suggester's impact on the quality of the results, not just their quantity.</li>
  
  </ul>
